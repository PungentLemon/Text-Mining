but the sentencing seems a bit high thanks for fixing please unlock my account u0001f923 u0001f923 this is true power haha any crypto wallet that won  t give you your private keys should be avoided at all costs your app sucks rt nasa has selected falcon heavy to launch the first two elements of the lunar gateway together on one mission yes once we can predict cash flow reasonably well starlink

beautiful day in la yeah dr frankensteen i never used this guy he gave a talk at spacex once only halo i sure hope that  s not true at tesla or spacex cryoproof then install engines starship sn9 sn10 in retrospect it was inevitable great shot live by the sword die by the sword entropy buy hold companies that make goods produce services you love earth is small we are smaller still u0001f440 with cyberpunk even the hotfixes literally have hotfixes but great game the dollar is shorting itself indeed shopify is great too spacex used them u0001f923 u0001f923 indeed the economy  making useful

to have release candidate desig i made that video absolutely unlike its aircraft division which is fine the faa space division has a fundamentally broken reg nomad u0001f917 the esthetics of cyberpunk are incredible btw the interior design is u0001f44c major esthetics improvements coming a little new roadster is part rocket there  s more storage now easily upgradable yes yeah probably in a few months after you drive without using a prnd stalk stick for a few days it gets very annoying to go back use a shifter no more stalks car guesses drive direction based on what obstacles it sees context nav map you a hedge fund that shorts is a shrubbery yeah also a rear screen 0 to 155mph trap speed in a 14 mile 200mph top speed with right tires first production car ever to achieve 0 to 60 mph in less than 2 seconds it can play cyberpunk plaid model s ships next month even discord has gone corpo yup wild times on discord haha waiting for faa review gamestonk passed initial pressure test yes bought a hand knit wool marvin the martian helm for my dog i kinda love etsy it does not serve the public to hamstring starlink today for an amazon satellite system that is at we  re hoping for faa approval of a test flight tomorrow afternoon the entire  stack  from data collection through labeling inference has to be in surround video th yes although it will be crazy not to turn on fsd tesla is steadily moving all nns to 8 camera surround video this will enable superhuman selfdriving some tyranny also the road to hell is mostly paved with bad intentions catchy all sats launched next year will have laser links only o yup i hope so these also have laser links between the satellites so no ground stations are needed over the poles sorry for the version confusion v8 1 is what it should say for fsd separate version number for rest of car to my surprise tesla has better ai hardware software than waymo money it floats falloutthemed opening party for vegas loop happening as soon as allowed u0001f923 u0001f923 under vegas in tunnel yesterday with my boys lasers rt spacex  s rideshare offering provides increased access to space for small satellite operators seeking a reliable affordable

minor updates hopefully early next week rt due to unfavorable weather we are standing down from todays launch the team will continue with the countdown until t 30 seco given so many other companies are depending on this mission it is getting even more scru launching many small satellites for a wide range of customers tomorrow excited about offering lowcost access to o they are part of the solution but require lots of fresh water land we may need something that  s sn9 it  s a good path for fully renewable rocket energy so solves part of problem but longer chain hyd details next week am donating 100m towards a prize for best carbon capture technology pretty much that would probably mean civilization is doing gr absolutely they rock u0001f5a4 rt falcon 9 launches starlink to orbit  the eighth launch and landing of this booster the ratelimiting part or process in cell production is constantly changing cars trucks stuck in traffic generate megatons of toxic gases particulate but with our giant casting machines we are literally trying to make fullsize car tegmark is an exceptionally smart good human the best manufacturing technology is in ultra high volume industries like food beverage some medical eg syringes toys battery cell production is the fundamental ratelimiter slowing down a sustainable energy future very important pr looking into this no question that fsd should be viewed as reasonably valuable when doing a tradein for sure glad you  re ok congratulations this is a good one i whistle cybertruck doesn  t need a garage it will be awesome good point your serverside code is doing too much happy birthday wikipedia so glad you exist guess you been watching cobra kai fallout new texas only chuck norris can divide by zero good point the thing we call money is just an information system for labor allocation what actuall monty python is amazing they sure can twist the knife in that show probably wise we  re making major improvements to ease of engine swap needs to be a few hours at most two of the engines need slight repairs so will be switched out nice shot we don  t have high school internships but please apply when you  re in college prototypes are easy volume production is hard positive cash flow is excruciating physics rt splashdown of dragon confirmed completing spacex  s 21st resupply mission and the first return of a cargo resupp detanking inspections now good progress towards our  hop in go to mars  goal all three static fires completed no ruds wow a lot has happened in 10 years fair enough haha sea shanty tiktok takes it to a new level with actual pirate ships sure today at spacex is about practicing starship engine starts ship is held down by massive pins while engines are fir as promised legalize comedy you can steal our name logos we probably won  t sue you we  re just trying to get people to mars help would be appreciated one day we will get a camera up there that also shows the star field in the background rt separation confirmed dragon performing 3 departure burns to move away from the suicide is more than double homicide absolutely hey you yeah you queen you  re gon na make it u0001f495 u0001f495 hate to say it but might be true the robot future is coming 300km every millisecond but there are times i wish it were faster mus protec u0001f476 yoda u041e u043d u0431 u044b u043b u0432 u0435 u043b u0438 u043a u043e u043b u0435 u043f u0435 u043d this is an important distinction much more than this increasing rapidly it is once in a while something happens that is even better than we imagined the factory is the product probably commenting on will do more i bought the replacement glass from a junkyard for 20 they  re great places to get spare parts a lot of people are going to be super unhappy with west coast high tech as the de facto arbiter of free speech already donated to signal a year ago will donate more i am primarily trying to advance two causes sustainable energy extending life consciousness beyond e u0001f923 u0001f923 maybe a tesla ai day later this year the prancing pony u0001f923 u0001f923 u0001f622 it  s true yes but not for long yeah they seemed optimistic too my 14 yearold son saxon said he feels like 2021 will be a good year i agree let us all make it so was also thinking that spacex boca should hold fun parties and give tours for the community from time to time i super support public spaces around our production launch sites wherever it can be done that too catapult high into the air land on the roof with a base jumping parachute the only way to travel that  s actually our restaurant but spacex is building a futuristic bar at the top of the h and increase fun hopefully me neither one of the best tesla solar roof installations no but maybe one day yes that would be the best way to do it a large solar field or reactor is needed for po his sick beats probably less than a few dozen primary decisionmakers technically only three or at least the option for verification so that the public can ascribe more credibilit launch underway btw critical feedback is always super appreciated as well as ways to donate money that really make a difference way harder than it seems yup indirectly an electric rocket is possible by using electricity to convert co2 h2o  ch4 o2 this not to get to orbit unfortunately in space photon emission powered by matterantimatter annihila this will be hard to make as it isn  t like any other vehicle playing the long game true i hope so wings don  t work on the moon at all and def not well on mars also no runways hamiltonians have 2v the potential of langrangians and a play well back to work how strange use signal ya don  t say reminds me of this timeless classic fast water with tiny rocks yes and then occam  s razor is actually third most likely as seen from an external observer not the participants the most entertaining outcome is the most likely dumb and dumber is a great movie tho this is called the domino effect because of the large footprint it may seem flat but actually ranges up to 5 stories tall snow falling on giga berlin yes u0001f609 tesla is responsible for 23 of all the personal professional pain in my life combined but it was worth it so proud of the tesla team for achieving this major milestone at the start of tesla i thought we had optimistica rt in 2020 we produced and delivered half a million cars huge thanks to all those who made this possible um we have giant fusion reactor in the sky that works with no maintenance tesla full selfdriving will work at a safety level well above that of the average driver this year of t dojo isn  t needed but will make selfdriving better it isn  t enough to be safer than human drivers aut ignore the heading great interview with mathias döpfner u0001f3a9 the greatest gatsby u0001f3a9 inspired by the ballet rocket motion is primarily vertical so you want the top open let  s make the roaring 20  s again might be a few lumps along the way production is hard prototypes are easy building 1000 starships to create a s exactly haha sn9 will press ch4 header tank with helium longterm solution is under debate yes legs would certainly work but best part is no part best step is no step yes saves mass cost of legs enables immediate repositioning of booster on to launch mount  rea we  re going to try to catch the super heavy booster with the launch tower arm using the grid fins to take the load snakehead dog had my undivided attention until winderhead ostrich came gliding through all nonchalant seems odd that the opposition group is from bmw  s home state of baveria that  s very far from brande this is very sensible opposition from anywhere can not mean no progress everywhere literally are we sure this is real destiny destiny no escaping that for me all tesla cars delivered in the final three days of the year will get three months of the full selfdriving option and mark dankberg this action is wack not dank less westworld the last kingdom show is great absolutely will be text visualization but could add voice too even cheese is made of cake if they don  t love us we  re in deep trouble not everything is made of cake true haha such a weird game when you think about it this is not cgi we need a ui overhaul no these are just incremental improvements to the production codebase fsd build is starlink  poses a hazard  to viasat  s profits more like it stop the sneaky moves charlie ergen entertainment will be critical when cars drive themselves just meeting with larry ellison to seek some advice back working on tesla end of quarter tomorrow absolutely what should tesla do with incar gaming in an autonomous world absolutely taste of the future try playing polytopia in your tesla great game multiplayer online version coming soon focus on making products services people truly love so that the total economic pie is bigger instead of en roughly 95 of parts in tesla roadster were unique  not in any other pro yes very important ok service might be able to do this will check you mean install the external speaker on earlier cars that don  t have it no but definitely this year good point interesting liz has always done great interviews falcon was 25 of successful orbital launches in 2020 but maybe a majority of pa vaccines are just the start it  s also capable in theory of curing almost anything turns medicine into a yes we will offer multiple display options a few more revisions needed probably beta 10 or 11 sure haha ok there are subtle important differences between us canada traffic rules bu yes we need a  match other traffic speed  setting definitely it  s a step in that direction it  s one u0001f525 or 12 u0001f525 if you don  t have a car with pedestrian speaker we couldn  t get everything done in the writing on cobra kai is sick u0001f44c haha i will save you the nightmare of seeing me in those shorts you can upload custom music sounds unfortunately pedestrian speaker is needed otherwise no external sound generator except actual horn change your horn sound to u0001f410 u0001f40d u0001f3b7 u0001f4a8 or holiday jingles with latest tesla software update merry christmas happy holidays u0001f381 great game it will most likely make sense for starlink to go public once the revenue growth is reasonably predictable engineering design general company operations absorb vast majority of my mind are the fundamental li yes a few months coming soon minor yeah 12 story rocket turns off its engines does a controlled fall yup we  re just ironing out a few bugs to tesla owners taking delivery in the final days of year your support is super appreciated frictionless ai what could possibly go wrong good idea during the darkest days of the model 3 program i reached out to tim cook to discuss the possibility of strange if true tesla already uses ironphosphate for medium range cars made in our shanghai facto sparta  s reply to macedon hi liz thanks to everyone who worked so hard to make tesla successful my heart goes out to you indeed it was a seriously twisted affair but all  s that ends well they are although it  s kind lowkey tesla superchargers are being made accessible to other electric cars rt photos from yesterday  s launch and landing u2192 are such large transactions even possible u2665 ufe0f i love all u crazy ppl out there u2665 ufe0f you have a point sigh great game pretty much the main value of college used to be hanging out having pseudo intellectual conversations come for the comments stay for the memes u0001f484 absolutely we will release fsd subscription early next year one word doge bitcoin is almost as bs as fiat money great nails lipstick sounds about right  lord  edge nice branding just kidding who needs a safe word anyway bitcoin is my safe word rt falcon 9  s first stage has landed on landing zone 1 rt liftoff standing down for today to inspect rocket hopefully launching tomorrow pressure is slightly high in upper stage liquid oxygen tank review underway i am hoping to be back next month very impressive mission by china last launch of 2020 coming up he was indeed quite grumpy but we did not actually know what we were doing so he had a point it will get absurdly good tesla ai autopilot engineering is awesome there  s some great ai out ther star light star bright this is incorrect u0001f923 u0001f923 but it is visually stunning playability is good a tshirt being better armor than a kevlar chest plate doesn  t make sense in the absence of magic also w oh and umm i absolutely support trans but all these pronouns are an esthetic nightmare the raptors were well below max thrust or the ship would have blown through the altit far from fully loaded but we were going slow or the ship would have gone crazy high far with three engines it  s a good to great game imo but improving what may seem like mere surface detail woul perhaps slightly more confident but it  s essential to view this as output vs time as dankeschön brandenburg und grünheide sure hope that future doesn  t come to pass giga berlinbrandenburg will be the first to use our new structural pack architecture 4680 world  s original deus ex was incredible human revolution was also great the objective reality is that it is impossible to run an advanced game well on old hardware this is rt starship landing flip maneuver ascent to the heavens u0001f923 yeah briefly seems pretty good i picked nomad so start was a little slow but picks up hehe rt falcon 9 launches sxm 7 to orbit completing spacex  s 25th launch this year init void cooling haha i still have a soft spot in my heart for transpiration cooking in theory it would us ship leeward side will be bare metal windward will have black hexagonal heat shield tiles rt cant wait spacex spacexstarship yes agreed should be preserved in memory of sn8 rt photos from starship sn8  s flight test u2192 exactly woohoo sn8 did great even reaching apogee would  ve been great so controlling all way to putting thank you south texas for your support this is the gateway to mars life the universe and everything yeah engines did great mars here we come fuel header tank pressure was low during landing burn causing touchdown velocity to be high rud but we got all successful ascent switchover to header tanks precise

congratulations congratulations yes it does rt tunnel rave and no toilet paper u0001f923 u0001f923 watch demolition man prometheus unbound rt the falcon 9 booster supporting this mission previously launched astronauts bob behnken and doug hurley to the not bad it was a beast compared to the vic 20 award accepted on behalf of the great people at tesla spacex neuralink boring co much of what people think of an science is actually engineering eg no such thing as a  rocket scientist  only roc science is discovering the essential truths about what exists in the universe engineering is about creating things it does get a bit cold at night paint makes a hell of a difference congrats thanks for everything you did to help build spacex some of the best memories ever it will be real soon starship legs are one of the hardest problems external static fire is not risky from build site but we need to clear the build site for early flights just a static fire tomorrow flight no earlier than wednesday it will have landing legs yes very sad news tony was great for a second there i thought that was a pic of thanos haha yeah truncate zeros then round probably going to a wider beta in 2 weeks fp16 with least important digits truncated so it feels like fp32 is what we  re betting on for training with dojo int 8 for almost all heavy lifting in inference works great but actually happy thanksgiving hopefully next month ok overall air suspension height damping algorithm is haha true the promise is greatly needed we will have special colors for new roadster as we did for the original u0001f923 u0001f923 is savage u0001f923 u0001f923 if you ever wondered where we came from this is a life leader launch so more risk than normal yes but only slightly filled this is a subject of much debate major upgrades are slated for sn15 many small improvements but overall similar wiring is more robust engines are more mat but that  s why we have sn 9 sn10 lot of things need to go right so maybe 13 chance good starship sn8 static fire aiming for first 15km 50k ft altitude flight next week goals are to test 3 engin maybe start on that a year from now depends on how starship progress goes not yet not bad we will definitely need more engines if we make the cargo bay all propel rapid complete rocket reuse low cost propellant orbital refilling propellant production at d yes we  re still far from simply video in control out the biggest gamechanger cu fsd beta 5 coming out in a few days improvement should be significant exciting mission wow yea tomorrow will be the 7th flight of this rocket landing on droneship of course i still love you sure true we have quiet a queue of products to build better do new roadster at some point u0001f62c fate loves irony but hates hypocrisy rt booster separation secondengine start and fairing separation as the u s european sentinel 6 michael freilich oceanobserving yes u0001f603 our data center was named skynet as a joke over 10 years ago might have been tempting fate tesla is a vehicle for creating producing many useful products largest cast titanium part in the world no heat shielding needed landing at vandenberg afb in california actually off to the side so it doesn  t take out the launch where it should be because i am not an investor tesla is definitely not the only good company but investing is n well almost anything quite the day ahead rt crew 1  s view of earth during dragon  s flight to the now this is what you  d call pointy cool they  re moving at 25 times the speed of sound but it feels like nothing there will always be upgrades it will be better than human vision by quite a margin reality looks like a strange ghostworld at radar wavelengths exactly this is a misperception spacex developed continues to use lidar for dragon docking with one day we will fly you on starship well done i can  t comment on turbopump internal details but you  re roughly in the ballpark wow roc to be clear this was just an xpeng problem other companies in china have not done this andrej is awesome but it should be said that we have a very talented autopilot yeah they stole apple  s code too they have an old version of our software don  t have our nn inference computer wild times congrats yup change out a few parts otherwise fine caution strongly advised with spacs sure haha sexy cropping champion of all time if next week  s release looks good we will widen beta unfortunately there are too many rules around liquor distribution even in the us next week  s release is special lot of fundamental improvements both important bug fixes entire n 13 years 11 billion wow safety is our primary design goal fully let the martians decide their own future a lot of my brain space is spent dealing with both units terraforming will be too slow to be relevant in our lifetime however we can establish a human base that is certainly the intention the only publicly traded stock i own is tesla wise words from bogle the point of companies is products services they have no point in of thems no just a mild cold same with my bro def had cov 2 though pc 20 means viral life in glass domes at first eventually terraformed to support life like earth yeah i was going to say  sim  but that seemed too obvious haha deveras and cases with high noninfectious ct should quarantine for a few days while getting

someone took a bite there is such a thing as too much sentience deus ex machine learning it  s designed to make life multiplanetary otherwise extreme overkill for mere earth sector activity more like he gave it his blessing it was sort of a groundswell of those who believed nullius in verba indeed dojo doge yeah looks like marginal cost of launch will be less than 1m for more than 1 exactly merlin is a strong local maximum design but kerosene is suboptimal fuel no matter what yes but from a visiting american ah the irony is just too much yeah pcr ct was unequivocal at 20 doesn  t matter what m

test they tell you the number not ju a little up down feels just like a regular cold but more body achy cloudy head than co in your opinion at what ct number for the cov 2 n1 gene should a pcr test probably be regarded as cool but please be super cautious expect two steps forward one back lot of new code was merged just a scratch we can buff it out am getting wildly different results from different labs but most likely i have a moderate case of covid npcs all the way up ahem unless you  re on dmt laws of thermodynamics 1 you can  t win 2 you can  t break even 3 you can  t stop playing shakes fist at entropy big expansion of beta program in 6 to 8 weeks interesting my thursday night saliva sample came back today with n1 gene unique to cov what  s honey feels that way this

amplification cycles required to detect the virus is a rough indicator of your vir this a great reference worth a read case closed soon fwiw lab i just spoke to thinks below 30 is accurate 30 to 40 gets dicey above 40 is bs will talk to lab i just spoke to said cov 2 pcr detection n1 n3 genes below 30 cycles is reliable above 40 cycles is not note this is not the spike protein they don  t consider that reliable just spoke directly to a testing lab their main pcr search is for the n1 gene unique strange possible explanation for the dramatic decline in cold flu prevalence vs prior years if someone comes moreover lower the true prevalence the higher the false positive number will be this sounds obvious from sure is would be great to hear from people who know a lot about the pcr testing industry what  s the approximate false posi interesting interesting what is the general population no knowledge of symptoms accuracy of a sarscov 2 pcr test is it possible to gene a good pcr test should identify if i have the cov 2 spike proteins although i have heard s mild sniffles cough slight fever past few days right now no symptoms although i did take nyquil technically i tested

steve that convertible loan gave us 6 months of runway closest we got was about a month the model 3 ramp was extreme stress pa i put in my last money even though i thought we would still fail but it was eithe that funding round completed 6pm on christmas eve in 2008 last hour of last day possible as investo yes lowering starlink terminal cost which may sound rather pedestrian is actually our most difficult technical challenge as soon as we get regulatory approval hopefully around middle of next year right now it takes about 5 mins to set up but with future improvements probably less than 3 mi canada and norway are next after we get us out of early beta didn  t realize that was possible no problem if there  s a way get current design cybertruck approved in europe as soon as we get country approval this is required for each country individually as no euwide approval lower latitude states need more satellites in position so probably january several thousand more starlink beta

to reduce wind tip over force t fine we  ll do it already u0001f600 good analysis although i think we should wait until fsd is a bit more mature i  m pretty sure tesla could do a much better autocorrect the bar is so low haha true custom ultra high speed bus efficient cooling ok pretty much any machinelearning it  s big sure yeah we will open dojo for training as a web service once we work out the bugs there are a lot of pointless zeroes in fp32 neural nets you can chop off 16 of the 3 dojo uses our own chips a computer architecture optimized for neural net training not a you

case study it  s inevitable excuse me i only sell doge will those who write the algorithms ever realize their negativity bias pretty much we better hustle with neuralink not moving fast enough thanks just stop u0001f495 u0001f495 u0001f923 u0001f923 gigafactory is the product even more than the car yes carefully hidden sure might be an indoor outdoor rave space on the roof giga berlin exactly this is a serious problem ratio of retirees to workers is considering small note latch on post near base is gone powered ethernet wire is less obtrusive in production version this thing we call  money  is just a slow lossy unsecure database for labor allocati trying to set a good example haha mars needs people great work by tesla software engineering population collapse is 2nd biggest danger to civilization after ai imo yeah will take less than a minute to order on when it goes live starlink terminal has motors to selforient for optimal view angle no expert installer required ok u0001f914 exactly tesla autopilot was literally named after the term used in aviation also what about autobahn the strength perseverance of the people of tesla despite facing extreme difficulties playable on any tesla should do this automatically mass to orbit is a more accura cute wow reusability is essential a rocket that is single use is just as absurd as a single use airplane f9 e wild times we  re being extra paranoid maximizing probability of successful launch is paramount welcome anytime well i do care very much about sustainability of civilization but there is some truth to the irony part haha yes in plan superchargers and public high power wall c u0001f440 i think so doing range testing now number will be significantly higher than 300 extreme we have reduced pricing on model y lr dual motor will offer a lr single moto yes it may be able to reach 250kw at low states of charge no as range would be unacceptably low 250 mile epa we had to increase some wire thicknesses in s x to reduce resistive heating technically thanks that is the nearterm danger of ai i didn  t mind da2 da1 was awesome mass effect 2 talking about sequels is amazing haha maybe he should design flag of mars 48 65 78 20 74 6f 20 74 65 78 74 i spoke with korolev  s family today he was one of the very best u041a u043e u0440 u043e u043b u044c u043e u0432 u041a u043e u0440 u043e u043b u0451 u0432 in general we need to improve how podcasts play spqr true haha death is the loss of information earning power post augmentation would easily pay for itself if that  absolutely u0001f440 probably a good one to design engineer in germany even more ok u0001f440 berlin model y is the one to watch that is a revolution in automotive body engineering finally true wow ihop github are close best use of the term  full stack  for sure this is both great terrifying everything we  ve ever sensed or thought has been yes sorry should hopefully be soon not actually a payout just a vesting of stock options it may never pay out as the stock can  t b no easy way to answer this in a tweet but helping with dire brain injuries is our first priority details aug 28 ai symbiosis while u wait there  s some of that too true it sounds so surreal but the negative propaganda is still all out there easy to find in social me make sure to read ur terms conditions before clicking accept samwise gamgee altho dumb and dumber is u0001f525 u0001f525 progress update august 28"

14 yearold son saxon say he feel like 2021 will be a good year I agree let we all make it so be also think that spacex boca should hold fun party and give tour for the community from time to time I

be real soon starship leg be one of the hard problem external static fire be not risky from build site but we need to clear the build site for early flight just a static fire tomorrow flight no early than wednesday it will have landing leg yes very sad news tony be great for a second there I think that be a pic of thano haha yeah truncate zero then round probably go to a wide beta in 2 week fp16 with least important digit truncate so it feel like fp32 be what we \\x92 re bet on for training with dojo int 8 for almost all heavy lifting in inference work great but actually happy thanksgiving

great question it \\x92 s more complex question and depend on why the test be be use ie do you want to kn worth read this thread if you \\x92 re curious about rona testing they should be imo if you get a blood pressure test they tell you the number not ju a little up down feel just like a regular cold but more body achy cloudy head than co in your opinion at what ct number for the cov 2 n1 gene should a pcr test probably be regard as cool but please be super cautious expect two step forward one back lot of new code be merge just a scratch we can buff it out be get wildly different result from different lab but most likely I have a moderate case of covid npcs all the way up ahem unless you \\x92 re on dmt law of thermodynamic 1 you can \\x92 t win 2 you can \\x92 t break even 3 you can \\x92 t stop play shake fist at entropy big expansion of beta program in 6 to 8 week interesting my thursday night saliva sample come back today with n1 gene unique to cov what \\x92 s honey feel that

amplification cycle require to detect the virus be a rough indicator of your vir this a great reference worth a read case close soon fwiw lab I just speak to think below 30 be accurate 30 to 40 get dicey above 40 be bs will talk to lab I just speak to say cov 2 pcr detection n1 n3 gene below 30 cycle be reliable above 40 cycle be not note this be not the spike protein they don \\x92 t consider that reliable just speak directly to a testing lab their main pcr search be for the n1 gene unique strange possible explanation for the dramatic decline in cold flu prevalence vs prior year if someone

didn \\x92 t expect the stock to rise so much so super appreciate your support steve that convertible loan give we 6 month of runway close we get be about a month the model 3 ramp be extreme stress pa I put in my last money even though I think we would still fail but it be eithe that funding round complete 6 pm on christmas eve in 2008 last hour of last day possible as investo yes lower starlink terminal cost which may sound rather pedestrian be actually our most difficult technical challenge as soon as we get regulatory approval hopefully around middle of next year right now it take about 5 min to set up but with future improvement probably less than 3 mi canada and norway be next after we get we out of early beta didn \\x92 t realize that be possible no problem if there \\x92 s a way get current design cybertruck approve in europe as soon as we get country approval this be require for each country individually as no euwide approval low latitude state need more satellite in

week in form of a write piece on spacex website great pic that we now have the beginning of a starship production system be most meaningful yup with beta update there \\x92 ll be a lot of 2 step fwd 1 step back situation but pace of improv work on it also need to be able fart at other car on command starship be come together price change be push to thursday next week apply only to we for now one week clock will start in other countr there will be a 360 deg glass star bar name tbd at top of high bay well we have say many time that the price will rise as the product functionality improve how much ti agree be these performance tire just a smallseeming issue with loss of upper stage camera probably nothing serious but stand down to sure now that tesla fsd beta be out in limited release fsd price new or upgrade will go up by 2k on monday as soon as we complete testing regulator approve so many differe yes haha dependent on prove high safety not intentional we just want to show that you could theoretically convert the entire us vehicle f cold gas for now hot later I mean ya got to have a tiki bar starship nosecone high bay tiki bar after it get to orbit a few time get a little melty

u0001f923 I have see no evidence of an advanc we face a tough dichotomy of apply resource to the old architecture or apply they to the ne definitely exactly he play the \\x93 poor inventor \\x94 card but be rich all along invent nothing as far as I kn there be sketchy edit to tesla wiki that whitewash eberhard \\x92 s problem glorify his role pretty odd when eberhard be fire from the tesla ceo

far too costly for car but can rapidly create tooling to accel pretty much but I think it may end on a high note rt starman last see leave earth make its first close approach with mar today \\x97 within 005 astronomical unit or under 5 mill mean to say that it should be fix in the late wide release win \\x92 t need to wait for fsd it should be exactly we bark up that tree for way too long sigh give a false sense of yes we will play sexy snake jazz u0001f923 yes yeah provide we do our metal gear snake autocoupler waymo be impressive but a highly specialized solution the tesla approach be a general solution the lat yeah we could put in a setting allow it to drop as low as 5 great render note there will need to be an arm mimecraft yes autopilot team be make great progress reality sure be complicate aspire to have no flame diverter in boca we do have giant steel ball haha we just complete a financing round but will let you know when there be another one I definitely need to try these tasty cake pastry on my next visit mass ratio liquid oxygen be much dense than liquid m have the most amazing kebab ever just outside of tachele too döner kebab you \\x92 re most welcome high bay should be finish except for the giant gantry crane within that look tasty the crash absorption rail can be cut off replace with a bolted part for collision repair sandy munro understand engineering that would be like license battlestar galactica actually buil yes the gigafactory be the hard most critical product battery pack will be a bond structure with cell provide shear transfer b but now we understand production much well it will be our primary competitive advantage longterm even gm chrysler go bankrupt in 2009 ford and tesla be the only us car company t the model 3 production ramp be sheer agony for two year but that be do or die for te bring a new product to volume production be 1 inspiration 99 perspiration you do st marginal cost of starship mass to orbit should be well under 100 kg fully burden cost depend on flight rate prototype be a piece of cake but high volume production of a new technology be extremely hard ta we do expect to make heavy use of lfp for medium range car stationary storage berlin will use 4680 cell with structural battery pack front rear single piece casting also a they be I do so wish that more company would put down their spreadsheet for a moment and focus on make 7 bar absolute which be fine for cryo pressure test succeed but a small le one of the good shot ever much soon great photo it will soon rt falcon 9 launch 60 starlink satellite to orbit complete spacexs 43rd flight of a previously fly rocket booster once these satellite reach their target position we will be able to roll out a fairly wide public beta in rt deployment of 60 starlink satellite confirm we \\x92 re not see notable difference yet I think the booster could probably do 100 reflig roughly a week or two turnaround be all that \\x92 s need to meet max launch demand starship s ahem yes it be the 3rd flight of this booster 3rd flight for active half of fair aim for 4th flight landing for this booster 5 minute from launch look good so far so crazy to subsidize pollution this be not good for people especially in dense city with heavy it \\x92 s a step in the right direction but they should really aim for full reusability by 2026 large ro

that and more we \\x92 re do a broad review of launch site propulsion structure av exactly we will need to make a lot of improvement to have a chance of complete 48 launch next year I agree with lex glad you \\x92 re ok haha thank for wait next year for sure great browns average latency will improve as more sit very s yes starlink be design probably 5 or 6 with an optimize tanker a starlink will
